# About

This is a guided project from the Scrimba frontend Path. In this project I build a meme generator with the aim to achieve the following learning objectives.

## Core LOs

- Event Listeners
- State
- Conditional Rendering
- Forms
- Side Effects

## Additional LOs

Along with the officially prescribed learning objective, I will also learn to use:

- emotion/styled
- Typescript

# Known Issues

- The styling is not ideal.
- Does not work on mobile.

# Reflections

- I was able to achieve all the prescribed learning objectives.
- In parallel, I explored
  - Next 13, and hence CSS Modules
  - SWR
  - Abramov's blog
  - Server Components
- I realized
  - I will eventually need to learn a Form handling library
  - Next also allows me to handle backend, so I won't have to worry about express in near future
    - I may have to learn SWR and tRPC
